<h1>Time-Conversion-Bot</h1>
<p>This is a Discord bot made by me for the purpose of accessibility. I noticed there was a huge issue with time generally being in timezones such as EST, but what about other countries I thought? So I decided to make this bot to try and accomplish this goal.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>What this bot does is detect when a user sends a time in UTC using RegEx, and then sends a message with time conversions in GMT, EST, CST, MST, and PST. I was planning on adding more timezones but I never really had the chance.</p>
<h2>Proof that it works</h2>
